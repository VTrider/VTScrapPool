# VT's Scrap Pool

This is a work in progress and should not be considered stable or ready for production use. Once there's a complete build I'll make a release and write complete documentation.

This library uses an object oriented API and is focused on multiplayer scripting and netcode. It also provides classes that wrap many stock systems like the cinematics, as well as various utilities like timers, holograms, and containers like sets, pairs, etc.
